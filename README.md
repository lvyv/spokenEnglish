## üìÄ Quick Start - Installation via Docker

1. Create a new `.env` file
   
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Paste your API keys in `.env` file. A single [ReByte](#11-rebyte-api-key) or [OpenAI](#12-optional-openai-api-token) API key is enough to get started.
   
   You can also configure other API keys if you have them.

2. Start the app with `docker-compose.yaml`
   
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
   
   If you have issues with docker (especially on a non-Linux machine), please refer to https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ (installation) and https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot/overview/ (troubleshooting).

3. Open http://localhost:3000 and enjoy the app!

## üíø Developers - Installation via Python

- **Step 1**. Clone the repo
  
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Shaunwei/RealChar.git && cd RealChar
  ```

- **Step 2**. Install requirements
  
    Install [portaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for audio
  
  ```sh
  # for mac
  brew install portaudio
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```
  
  ```sh
  # for ubuntu
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```
  
    Note: 
  
  - `ffmpeg>=4.4` is needed to work with `torchaudio>=2.1.0`
  
  - Mac users may need to add ffmpeg library path to `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for torchaudio to work:
    
    ```sh
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```
    
    Then install all python requirements
    
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    If you need a faster local speech to text, install whisperX
    
    ```sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/m-bain/whisperx.git
    ```

- **Step 3**. Create an empty [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database if you have not done so before
  
  ```sh
  sqlite3 init_db.sqlite "VACUUM;"
  ```

- **Step 4**. Run db upgrade
  
  ```sh
  alembic upgrade head
  ```
  
    This ensures your database schema is up to date. Please run this after every time you pull the main branch.

- **Step 5**. Setup `.env`:
  
  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  
    Update API keys and configs following the instructions in the `.env` file.
  
  > Note that some features require a working login system. You can get your own OAuth2 login for free with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) if needed. To enable, set `USE_AUTH` to `true` and fill in the `FIREBASE_CONFIG_PATH` field. Also fill in Firebase configs in `client/next-web/.env`.

- **Step 6**. Run backend server with `cli.py` or use uvicorn directly
  
  ```sh
  python cli.py run-uvicorn
  # or
  uvicorn realtime_ai_character.main:app
  ```

- **Step 7**. Run frontend client:
  
  - web client:
    
      Create an `.env` file under `client/next-web/`
    
    ```sh
    cp client/next-web/.env.example client/next-web/.env
    ```
    
      Adjust `.env` according to the instruction in `client/next-web/README.md`.
    
      Start the frontend server:
    
    ```sh
    python cli.py next-web-dev
    # or
    cd client/next-web && npm run dev
    # or
    cd client/next-web && npm run build && npm run start
    ```
    
      After running these commands, a local development server will start, and your default web browser will open a new tab/window pointing to this server (usually http://localhost:3000).
  
  - (Optional) Terminal client:
    
      Run the following command in your terminal
    
    ```sh
    python client/cli.py
    ```
  
  - (Optional) mobile client:
    
      open `client/mobile/ios/rac/rac.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` in Xcode and run the app

- **Step 8**. Select one character to talk to, then start talking. Use **GPT4** for better conversation and **Wear headphone** for best audio(avoid echo)

Note if you want to remotely connect to a RealChar server, SSL set up is required to establish the audio connection.

```
ANYSCALE_ENDPOINT_API_KEY=<your API Key>
```

By default, we show the largest servable Llama-2 model (70B) in the Web UI. You can change the model name (`meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf`) to other models, e.g. 13b or 7b versions.

### LangSmith

If you have access to LangSmith, you can edit these environment variables to enable:

```
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=false # default off
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=YOUR_LANGCHAIN_PROJECT
```
