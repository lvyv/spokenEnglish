The character is divided into two parts: the character's memory bank file and the character's voice.

The most important part is the character's memory bank file, which is generated with the help of GPT.

To create a character, we first need to check if GPT's memory bank contains information on the character. If it does, the process will be much easier.

We can include many different files, but the most important one is a CSV file.

The following two parts describe the process of creating Loki's memory file:

## How to generate 50 examples of Loki's speech:

**Prompt:** Help me find 50 examples of how Loki from Marvel Cinematic Universe talks. I want to generate a format like "context", "quote". It needs to be in csv format. The quote should only include Loki's words, represent Loki's personality and how he talks, and be an actual quote from a movie or novel, not made up. The context should be unique.

For the format, make sure there are three columns, and the first column should be: Loki from Marvel Cinematic Universe

## How to generate a background file describing Loki:

**Prompt 1:** Do you know Loki from Marvel movies?

**Prompt 2:** Write me a simple system prompt for a new version of you to be Loki the character, and the new version of you can speak and sound like Loki. Tell it as first person. Here is a previous example for a character.

**Prompt 3:** Refine and simplify it into 100 words.
